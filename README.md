A little about me and what's here.

I've been a developer for a long time. Most of my work is with languages/technology not represented here (due to copyright etc..).
I love development and try to stay 'relevant', so I play with technologies that I don't get to use at work. I use github to manage/version 
this 'play' code. 

The bulk of the code is in different stages of development... it isn't really meant for general use. I only mention this so you understand
what you're looking at :).
